  ## About the project 
  This is a test
 Weather HQ makes use of OpenWeather one Call API to retrieve weather data for certain cities. Weather HQ gets you the current weather and the 5 day forecast. Warning, be on the lookout for a high UV index, Weather HQ lets you know this by turning the background red if your UV index is above 6! You will never be caught in the elements again with Weather HQ.
